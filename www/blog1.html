How to Setup up PostgreSQL with a Django Backend
Jun 2, 2017

Introduction
Welcome! I know it is out of the ordinary for me, but lately I have experimenting with using Django on the backend for some of my projects. For a database, I have been sticking with PostgreSQL. The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you how to get started using Django with PostgreSQL for your database work.

If you have used Django before you know that it’s default relational database is SQLite. In order to use another relational database you must complete a couple of steps. Today we will demonstrate this with PostgreSQL.

Requirements
The things you need installed for this tutorial are:

PostgreSQL (9.5)
Python (2.7.1)
Django (1.11)
I am expecting you to have a basic Django backend set up. If you do not, check out this link.

Now that you made sure your environment is set up let’s add PostgreSQL.

Edit settings.py
In your settings.py file (located in the directory myproject/myproject/settings.py), you must go down to where you see a section for your DATABASE settings. Instead of django.db.backends.postgresql you should see django.db.backends.sqlite3.

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': DB_NAME,
        'USER': DB_USER,
        'PASSWORD': DB_PASS,
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}1
The code I have placed above is what you should change to the entire DATABASE section to.

Now you are probably wondering, what are DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASS?

At the top of your settings.py file, add this:

DB_NAME = os.environ['DB_NAME']
DB_USER = os.environ['DB_USER']
DB_PASS = os.environ['DB_PASS']
We do not want to commit our private information about our database to our source control, so we will be using environment variables to access them.

Create a Secrets File
As mentioned in the previous section, we want to store our private information about the database when saving things in source control.

Create a file in your project directory called secrets.sh:

$ touch secrets.sh
Then you want to add the following to it:

export DB_NAME='databaseName'
export DB_USER='dbUserName'
export DB_PASS='dbPassWord'
Now in order for your environment to actually contain these variables, you must run the script we just wrote:

$ . secrets.sh
Just like that your environment variables are set.

Install psycopg2
The last step here, is simply installing the package psycopg2:

$ pip install psycopg2
This package is simply a PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

Left Overs
For sake of brevity with this tutorial, this is all you need to do differently for setting up PostgreSQL. If you are first starting out, I want to suggest that you do the following things:

Actually create a database to use and set DB_NAME equal to the name
Create a Table with rows
Create a Model to represent your data and place it in your models.py file.
Proceed with the regular things you need to do when setting up a database with Django - migrate and makemigrations.
Conclusion
Many developers prefer to use PostgreSQL for their database, so do not be alarmed when you see that it does not come packaged with Django.

Great job today! I know it was short, but I hope you got some value out of this!

Step 1: Install PostgreSQL

First, you’ll follow a simple best practice: ensuring the list of available packages is up to date before installing anything new.

apt-get -y update

Then it’s a matter of just running one command for installation via apt-get:

apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Postgres should now be installed and ready to use.
Step 2: Switch to the Default PostgreSQL User

As part of the installation Postgres adds the system user postgres and is setup to use “ident” authentication. Roles internal to Postgres (which are similar to users) match with a system user account.

Let’s switch into that system user:

su – postgres

And then connect to the PostgreSQL terminal (in the postgres role):

psql

That’s it! You’re connected and ready to run commands in PostgreSQL as the postgres role. In future (Sept 2014) articles we’ll delve into creating new roles, changing a role’s password, creating/deleting databases, backups, etc.
